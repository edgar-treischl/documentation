## ‚úÖ Lessons Learned from Exploring Airflow vs. Your R `trigger` System

### 1. **Airflow Can Monitor & Orchestrate Your R-Based `trigger` System**

- Your existing `spectr`, `octopussy`, and `trigger` packages can be orchestrated **directly within Airflow**.
    
- Airflow gives you:
    
    - Scheduling
        
    - Failure detection + retries
        
    - Logs and alerting
        
    - Visual DAGs for your pipeline logic
        

üìå _No need to replace `trigger` ‚Äî just wrap it in Airflow if/when you scale._

### 2. **Airflow Is Ideal for Multi-Language Workflows**

- If your future stack includes:
    
    - Python (ETL, ML, APIs)
        
    - Bash (cron-style scripts)
        
    - SQL (via dbt or raw queries)
        
    - R (validation via your packages)
        
- Then **Airflow is the right place** to unify all of it.
    

üß† _It‚Äôs your cross-language conductor._

### **Add a Central Data Discovery UI to Your Shiny App**

- Your metadata pointers in GitLab are gold ‚Äî now make them searchable and browsable.
    
- Users should be able to:
    
    - Search tables/columns by name, tags, owners
        
    - View validation status, schema, metadata
        
    - Browse by domain or data steward
        

‚úÖ Build this in Shiny ‚Äî just expose metadata from GitLab/YAML via plumber API or directly in-app.

### 4. **Implement User Identification in Shiny**

- So you can:
    
    - Track who accessed what
        
    - Gate metadata editing by user/team
        
    - Enable role-based discovery views
        

üîê Use `shiny::session$user`, `shinyjs`, or external auth (like GitLab OAuth, LDAP, etc.) for proper **RBAC**.
